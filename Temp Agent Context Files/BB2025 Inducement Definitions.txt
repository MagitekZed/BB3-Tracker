For each Prayer to Nuffle a team purchases, roll a D16 (re-rolling any results a team has already rolled) and consult the Prayers to Nuffle Table opposite to see the effect that Nuffle has bestowed upon the team. Prayers to Nuffle last until the end of the game. If a Prayer to Nuffle requires players to be selected, then Star Players may never be selected under any circumstances.

0-1 BIASED REFEREE
PRICE VARIES
Biased Referees vary in cost, with some costing more than others. Here we provide the rules and cost for a Dodgy League Rep, though other named Biased Referees may be available in other Blood Bowl publications. Other Biased Referees will have their own entry, which will list their cost, teams that can hire them, and special rules.
It is possible for both teams to hire the same named Biased Referee.
BIASED REFEREE: DODGY LEAGUE REP
120,000 GOLD PIECES (80,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM
A team that has hired a Dodgy League Rep gains the following benefits:
CLOSE SCRUTINY
Immediately after an opposition player performs a Foul Action, roll a D6. On a 1-4, nothing happens. On a 5+, the opposition player is immediately Sent-off.
"I DIDN'T SEE A THING!"
When you attempt to Argue the Call, apply a +1 modifier to the roll. A roll of a natural 1 will still count as "You're Outta Here!" as normal.
0-1 INFAMOUS COACHING STAFF
PRICE VARIES
Infamous Coaching Staff vary in how they operate, with some costing more than others. Here we provide the rules and cost for Josef Bugman, though other named Infamous Coaching Staff may be available in other Blood Bowl publications. Other Infamous Coaching Staff will have their own entry, which will list their cost, teams that can hire them, and special rules. It is possible for both teams to hire the same named Infamous Coaching Staff.
INFAMOUS COACHING STAFF: JOSEF BUGMAN
100,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM

DWARVEN WISDOM
Once per game, after teams have been set up but before Kick-off, a team that has hired Josef Bugman can remove D3 of their players from the pitch and set them up again following all of the usual restrictions.
0-3 MERCENARY PLAYERS
PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM
Any team can hire Mercenary Players. These are players from your team's Team Roster, though they will cost an additional 30,000 gold pieces to induce. For example, a Mercenary Human Lineman would cost 80,000 gold pieces – 50,000 for their initial cost, plus 30,000 for being a Mercenary.
Mercenary Players will still count as one of the type of player they are, so you can't use Mercenary Players to increase the number of specific player types you can have on a team. However, players that are missing their next game do not count towards the total number of a player type on their team and so will not prevent a Mercenary Player of their player type.
Mercenary Players automatically gain the Loner (4+) Trait in addition to their usual Skills and Traits. Mercenary Players may be given a single Primary Skill at a cost of 50,000 gold pieces. Unlike Journeymen, Mercenary Players cannot be hired during the Post-game Sequence.
0-2 STAR PLAYERS
PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS
A team may hire up to a maximum of two Star Players for a game. This cannot be used to take the number of players on a team above 16; however, players that are missing the next game do not count when working out the number of players a team has available.
Star Players that must be hired as a pair only count as a single Star Player choice, but will still take up two individual spaces on a team's Team Roster.
It is possible for both teams to hire the same Star Player, in which case both teams can field the Star Player – one of them is simply just a very talented imposter!
Star Players cannot earn Star Player Points, be awarded the MVP, can never gain Player Advancements and any Casualty Rolls made against them will automatically be waived at the end of the game – Star Players are wealthy enough to pay for the very best medical treatment and resurrection spells!
The list of available Star Players can be found on pages 193-196. Each Star Player profile will explain which teams can hire them and how many gold pieces they will cost to hire. Additional Star Players can be found in the Star Players PDF which can be found at warhammer-community.com.
0-1 WIZARD
PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM
Wizards vary in cost, with some costing more than others. Here we provide the rules and cost for a Sports-Wizard, though other named Wizards may be available in other Blood Bowl publications. Other Wizards will have their own entry, which will list their cost, teams that can hire them, and special rules. It is possible for both teams to hire the same named Wizard.
WIZARD: SPORTS-WIZARD
150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM
Once per game, a Sports-Wizard can cast one of the following two spells:
FIREBALL
At the end of any Turn, before the next Turn begins, you may select any square on the pitch. Roll a D6 for any player that is in or adjacent to the selected square. On a 1–3, they avoid the fireball and nothing happens. On a 4+, the player has been hit by the fireball.
Any Standing player that is hit by the fireball is immediately Knocked Down and a +1 modifier is applied to the Armour Roll. Any Prone or Stunned player that is hit by a fireball will immediately have an Armour Roll made against them, applying a +1 modifier to the Armour Roll. These modifiers must always be applied.
ZAP!
At the end of any Turn, before the next Turn begins, you may select any player on the pitch and roll a D6. If the roll on the D6 is less than the selected player's ST, or the roll is a natural 1, then nothing happens. If the roll on the D6 is equal to or higher than the selected player's ST, or the roll is a natural 6, then the player is turned into a Frog. If they were holding the ball then it will Bounce from their square.
A Frog has the following profile:
FROG (FROG, SPECIAL)
	MA
	ST
	AG
	PA
	AV
	Skills & Traits
	

	5
	1
	2+
	5+
	9+
	Dodge, Leap, No Ball, Stunty, Titchy, Very Long Legs
	If a Frog suffers a Casualty, do not make a Casualty Roll for them. Instead, they will automatically suffer the Badly Hurt result. An Apothecary cannot be used on a Frog. At the end of the current Drive, the player turned into a Frog will return to normal with no ill effects and be put in the Reserves Box ready for the next Drive.
